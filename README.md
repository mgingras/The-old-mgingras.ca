===================

My personal website -[x] originally created using github pages Minimal template. Since then hacked apart and modified to use Jekyll to serve up the content
http://www.mgingras.ca

To-do:

-[x] Find Thesaurus API 
-[x] Set up HTML UI, with text box on left, button in middle, output on right 
-[x] Use JQuery to register event listeners 
-[x] Use JQuery to modify paragraph on right hand side so that it mirrors text in box 
-[x] Basic request for synonyms 
-[x] Pass data from web application to server and get response back 
-[x] Modify the output field on the right with synonymized data 
-[ ] Implement natural language recognition and replace words with valid synonymz (verb, noun, adjective) (currently just replace with whichever has data(stupid))
