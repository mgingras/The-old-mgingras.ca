The Tortoise And The Hare
===
#####A simulation of the age old tale - The Tortoise and the Hare - Programmed in C++coding
***

This project simulates a tortoise, represented by '```@```', and hare, represented by '```^```', racing to the peak of a mountain.

This programs Model and Controller are written in C++, the view is implemented using the curses Library.


In order for it to run optimally and be entertaining I recommend running the game in a maximized Terminal window, however it will function in any sized window.

Instructions:

1. To compile this project, open a terminal in the cloned directory and type "```make```" 
2. This will compile and link all required files code.  
3. Once compiled and linked enter "```./race```" to execute the binary, after which follow the on-screen isntructions.
