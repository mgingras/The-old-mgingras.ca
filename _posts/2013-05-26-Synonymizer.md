Program to take inputted text and substitute words within it with their synonyms.

Backend server written in node.js.   

I have recently taken a keen interest in web development and am looking to hone my skills in it. I have heard very good things about NodeJS and as such have decided to pursue it. What particularly appeals to me about node is the simplicity of creating non-blocking code and writing both front and back end in JavaScript.    

If I become particularly comfortable during this project in JS I may try to write some of the more simple front end JS in CoffeeScript.
