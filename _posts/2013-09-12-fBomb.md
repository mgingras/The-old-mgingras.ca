This is my latest project that I recently started to expand my skills using a variety of public API's.   

The concept behind this application is to plot tweets containing the "F word" on a google map.

###Here against your will?!
You may have arrived on this site due to an error occurring on Fbomb.co. If so, I am very sorry for the inconvenience I am trying to handle the growing pains of this site and will hopefully have it fixed soon!

If you want to peruse some tweets with the "F-Word", check out the site's Twitter handle: [@Fbomb_co](https://twitter.com/FBomb_co)

###Inspiration
My inspiration for this application actually came from a discussion I had with two colleagues of mine while doing co-op at BlackBerry, [Ryan Seys](http://ryanseys.com/) and Elliott Ro. We were talking about how people misuse and abuse the english language. As the conversation devolved swearing was brought up. In particular we talked about how swearing can completely undermine ones argument. Earlier that day we had been talking about the personal projects we were working and, somehow at this point we circled back to that topic. From there our conversation wound it's way to how itâ€™d be neat to map where people swear. Within a few minutes and iterations of ideas the concept for the app was born.

###Launch
It took me a few months to get around to coding this application, I originally wrote using Ruby on Rails however ended up re-writing it using CoffeeScript on Node.JS. I wrote it over the weekend of October 19th - 20th and published it that Sunday.

###Reaction
Overall this app has gotten a positive reaction, some people have different ideas of how it should have been implemented (other languages, customizable, etc.). However, I believe that many of those changes would detract from the actual intent of the app.   

I am surprised by how wide spread the attention has been for for this website, however I agree that it is pretty entertaining and, in my humble opinion worth the 30-60 seconds it generally receives.

###Technical Stuff
This site was originally written Ruby on Rails, see [code](https://github.com/mgingras/fBomb-rails). However as I publishing it I started to have issues
 with the tweet stream gem I was using. Since I didn't really need any of the benefits of using Rails for this project, I opted to re-write the server in a framework I'm more comfortable with.

I did my initial re-write using JS on Node.js. This didn't take too long since I already had much of the logic figured out from my work with rails. Therefore, I decided to push myself and attempt to re-write it in CoffeeScript.

This experimentation ended up working out really well. The syntax for CoffeeScript is quick to learn and much more fun to write that vanilla JavaScript. If you are interested, the original server (in JS) is still in my Github for this project, in addition to the CoffeeScript.

Please feel free to peruse my code and check out the site, if you have any suggestions I would love to hear it.

Changes since initial completion:   

- I added code to capture tweets tagged with a 'Place' that will hopefully cause more
tweets to be captured. Most of these tweets use a bounding box will be mapped at the center of that box.   

- I am also now using the coordinates tag instead of the geo tag as the primary
mapping coordinate, since the geo tag is being deprecated.   

- I have added a Twitter account, [@Fbomb_co](https://twitter.com/FBomb_co),
which will sporadically re-tweet "F-Bombs".

- Now only re-tweeting the most popular "F-Bomb" dropper.
