This is my latest project that I recently started to expand my skills using a variety of public API's.   

The concept behind this application is to plot tweets containing the "F word" on a google map.     

<!-- abridge -->

I originally wrote using Ruby on Rails, see [code](https://github.com/mgingras/fBomb-rails). However as I was publishing it I started to have issues
 with the tweet stream gem. Since I in fact did not need any of the benefits of using Rails on this project, I opted to re-write the server in a framework I'm more comfortable with.

I did my initial re-write using JS on Node.js. However, since that didn't take too long I decided to stretch myself and attempt to re-write it in CoffeeScript in an attempt to take
away some new skills.

It ended up working out really well, the syntax for CoffeeScript is quick to learn and really simple. Please peruse my code and the app, if you have any suggestions I would love to hear it.

Changes since initial completion:   

- I added code to capture tweets tagged with a 'Place' that will hopefully cause more
tweets to be captured. Most of these tweets use a bounding box will be mapped at the center of that box.   

- I am also now using the coordinates tag instead of the geo tag as the primary
mapping coordinate, since the geo tag is being deprecated.   

- I have added a Twitter account, [@Fbomb_co](https://twitter.com/FBomb_co),
which will sporadically re-tweet "F-Bombs".
