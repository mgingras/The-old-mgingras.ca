A game played over TCP/IP sockets where players take turns guessing each other's word. Once the game has started
inturrupts are blocked by the game until there is a winner. Only then does the winner have the chocie to leave. The
loser however is stuck in the game until they win (or kill the process from anothter terminal).

In order to play this game:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open a terminal window at that directory and enter "Make"
3. To play as the server/host just execute the binary (./probe)
4. To play as the client/join execute the binary with the command line argument of their ip
   address (i.e. "./probe 194.153.205.26")

From there just follow the on screen instructions and enjoy.
