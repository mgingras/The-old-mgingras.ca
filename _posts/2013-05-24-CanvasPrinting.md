<!-- abridge -->
The purpose of this site is to demostrate a simple photo gallery/canvas printing website with some basic featuers:

- Dynamic photo gallery that users can upload their own pictures
- Create an account and make order
- When in the shopping cart, final price will dynamically change based on the dimensions of the order
- Track past orders
