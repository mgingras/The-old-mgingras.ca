#####A simple photo gallery/print ordering proof of concept [website](http://mgprinting.herokuapp.com/).

***

This is a basic mock up of a potential web commerce website written with HTML, CSS, and modest JS with a PHP backended comunicating with a MySQL databse.
<!-- abridge -->
The purpose of this site is to demostrate a simple photo gallery/canvas printing website with some basic featuers:

- Dynamic photo gallery that users can upload their own pictures
- Create an account and make order
- When in the shopping cart, final price will dynamically change based on the dimensions of the order
- Track past orders

See the [code](https://github.com/mgingras/Canvas-Printing/) - Check out the [site](http://mgprinting.herokuapp.com/)
