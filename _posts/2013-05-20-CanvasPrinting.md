#####A Simple photo gallery/print ordering POC website

***

This is a basic proof of concept site written with HTML, CSS, and modest JS with a PHP backended.   
<!-- abridge -->
It's purpose is to demostrate a simple photo gallery/canvas printing website with some basic featuers:

- Dynamic photo gallery, users can upload their own pictures
- Create Users and make order
- Modify price based on the dimensions of the order
- Track past orders

*Currently Migrating this code so that it works on CLEARDB MySQL and Heroku -> some of the original fucntions are not supported*   

See the [code](https://github.com/mgingras/Canvas-Printing/) - Check out the [site](http://mgprinting.herokuapp.com/)
