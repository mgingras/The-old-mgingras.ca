#####A simple chess app for two players with potential move highlighting.

<p><strong>Built using:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="pict-prog-java icon-2x"> </span>Java</p>

***

I created this little project in my spare time the summer after first year to reinforce some of the lessons that I'd learnt at the time, particularly inheritance.   
<!-- abridge -->

I intend to in the future implement some of the following features into this little app:

- Endgame rules
- Saving your game/loading from previously saved game
- Simple UI (later perhaps more complex UI)
- Better graphical interface
