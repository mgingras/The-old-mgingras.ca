#####A floorplan app that allows you to visualize your layout and where the nearest safety exit would be.

<p><strong>Built using:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="pict-prog-java icon-2x"> </span>Java</p>



An application that I build that lets you create a simple floorplan and define exits, and then will
recursively track the nearest exit.

* Add/remove walls & exits:
